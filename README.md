# Senior-Seminar-Thesis
This repository contains all materials related to a research project I completed during my senior year for a seminar in sports economics. The project attempts to identify the effects of tournament policies and rules on doping behavior among cyclists, specifically in the Tour de France. The first part of the paper is purely theoretical. The second part of the paper is empirical and uses a dataset to test the effects of different variables on doping rate in the Tour de France using an OLS, fractional logistic, and LASSO regression.

This repository contains: .pdf file of the paper, .R file of raw code, .R file of cleaned dataset, .Rmd file of code.
